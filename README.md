NDH SQL Naming Convention Enforcement with SQLFluff
=========

This document outlines which naming conventions from the style guide can or cannot currently be enforced using SQLFluff, and provides configuration settings for enforceable rules. This ruleset is a extension and merger of three different rulesets for SQL tables: 

* [https://x.com/sehrope](https://x.com/sehrope) wrote [How I Write SQL, Part 1: Naming Conventions](https://launchbylunch.com/posts/2014/Feb/16/sql-naming-conventions/)
* [DURC](https://github.com/ftrotter/durc_is_crud) naming conventions
* [SQLFluff default rules](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/configuration/default_configuration.html)

We intend to write additional sqlfluff rules to support the rules that sqlfluff does not already support when possible. eventually. given infinite time and resources.

Rules Not Currently Enforceable by SQLFluff
------

These require either a custom rule, external linter, or manual review:

* Use full English words, not abbreviations
* Don’t use data types as names
* Use singular nouns for table names
* Primary key should be named id
* Foreign keys should follow the pattern <table>_id
  * Two foreign keys in the table requires a prefix on the foreign key column, to differentiate the two links. Like <helpfulname>_<table>_id etc.
  * Foreign keys can and will be created dynamically based on this naming convention. 
* Name indexes explicitly with table and column
* Name constraints clearly
* The varchar or text field in the table is assumed to be the "auto-suggest search" field for the table. If this is not true, then the table needs an explicit select_name field or postfixed field. 
* DURC Reserved names:
  * a column named select_name or that ends in _select_name is reserved for the field that will power an auto-suggest lookup on the table.
  * column names with a postfix of _markdown are used to invoke a front-end markdown editor
  * column names with a postfix of _code will invoke a code-editor on the front end.

Rules Enforceable by SQLFluff
------

These can be configured using standard SQLFluff rules:
* Avoid quoted identifiers
	→ L014: Discourages use of quoted identifiers.
* Use all lowercase for identifiers
	→ L010: Enforces case on keywords and identifiers.
* Use underscores to separate words (snake_case)
	→ L040: Enforces naming convention patterns.
* Avoid reserved words as identifiers
	→ L036: Detects use of reserved keywords as identifiers.

.sqlfluff Configuration
----

```conf
[sqlfluff]
dialect = postgres

[sqlfluff:rules]
exclude_rules = L009  # Optional: skip alias prefixing if undesired

[sqlfluff:rules:L010]
capitalisation_policy = lower  # Force lowercase for identifiers

[sqlfluff:rules:L014]
extended_capitalisation_policy = lower  # Reinforce lowercase for quoted identifiers
ignore_words = ''  # Do not allow any exceptions

[sqlfluff:rules:L036]
# No config needed — enabled by default

[sqlfluff:rules:L040]
capitalisation_policy = lower
naming_convention = snake_case
```
